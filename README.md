# Working with images
### Clone the code to the local
Use Git clone to clone a mirror copy of code to your dist (Run the command on your terminal):
```
git clone https://github.com/hustKiwi/sdm_lecture.git
```

### Check out to a specific demo
You can browser all the demo from the releases page: https://github.com/hustKiwi/sdm_lecture/releases

Then, checkout the code to the specific demo you want. For example, if I want to check the first demo, I should run the following command (use the particallar hash value it showed for the releases):
```
git checkout 19ab6cb
```
